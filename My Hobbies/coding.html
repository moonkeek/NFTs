It's been a few years already, and I can tell you that with the help of my teachers and parents, I have learned hundreds of commands. My expirience with coding is quite wild, honestly I'm pretty surprised I could remember all of these commands, I owe it all to my encouragement to continue learning and practicing. Hoping to get accepted into M.I.T, I have to master a bunch of coding languages. On my journey to achieve my goals life, I am truly thankful for all the help from teachers and people around me!</p></div>
